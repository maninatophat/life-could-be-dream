    Life could be a dream
    Life could be a dream
    Do do do do, sh-boom

    Life could be a dream (sh-boom)
    If I could take you up in paradise up above (sh-boom)
    If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love
    Life could be a dream, sweetheart

    Hello, hello again
    Sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again
    Boom (ba-boom)

    Day dong da ding-dong
    A-lang-da-lang-da-lang
    Ah, whoa, whoa, bip
    Ah bi-ba-do-da-dip, whoa

    Life could be a dream (sh-boom)
    If only all my precious plans would come true (sh-boom)
    If you would let me spend my whole life lovin' you
    Life could be a dream, sweetheart
    (Do do do do, sh-boom)

    Every time I look at you
    Something is on my mind
    If you do what I want you to do
    Baby, we'd be so fine

    Oh, life could be a dream, sh-boom
    If I could take you up in paradise up above, sh-boom
    You'd tell me, darlin', I'm the only one that you love
    Life could be a dream, sweetheart
    Hello, hello again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again, boom (ba-boom)

    Day dong da ding-dong

    Ah, whoa, whoa, bip
    Ah bi-ba-do-da-dip, whoa

    Life could be a dream
    Life could be a dream, sweetheart
